                                <p>Soochipara Waterfalls in Wayanad is a very famous attraction. Its name has been
                                    derived from two words- soochi meaning rock and para meaning needle. Since the rocks
                                    present here are in the form of a needle, the waterfall is also known as Sentinel
                                    Rock Waterfalls. The enrapturing waterfall has three tiers of water falling from
                                    100-200 feet height.</p>
