                                    <p>This is the first lighthouse at Alapuzha, a fixed one was exhibited from the port flag staff.<br/> This was maintained by the Princely state of Travancore and the exact date of commissioning of the light is not known. A Government order of 1837 regarding removing of light and knocking down of flag staff during monsoon period proves the existence of a lighthouse at Alapuzha well before that date. </p>
